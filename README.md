# Game-of-Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

### Rules
1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude ðŸ’€
2. Each cell with more than three neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation ðŸ’€
3. Each cell with more than one neighbor survives ðŸŒ±
4. Each cell with two neighbors becomes populated ðŸ‘¶


## How to play?
 1. Click anywhere in the grid to start placing cells
 2. Click Start!
